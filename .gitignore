# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if having platform-specific dependencies or dependencies
#   with no cross-platform support, pipenv may install dependencies that don't work, or even
#   fail to install them. In that case, version control of Pipfile.lock may not be the best practice.
#Pipfile.lock

# poetry
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, poetry.lock contains the resolved dependencies and should be
#   tracked in version control.
#poetry.lock

# pdm
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, pdm.lock contains the resolved dependencies and should be
#   tracked in version control.
#pdm.lock

# PEP 582; used by e.g. github.com/pdm-project/pdm
